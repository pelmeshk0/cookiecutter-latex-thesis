I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Thomas Schultz and my supervisor M.Sc. Mohammad Khatami for giving me a possibility to learn wonderful things about the complexities of human brain and helping me during the whole journey. Without their supervision, explanations and analysis this work would never appear.

I would also like to thank my family and my friends, Maxim and Kiril, for their moral support and motivation, that allowed me to overcome the difficulties of this year.

Last but not least, I wish to thank Dr. Nils Goerke, who has kindly agreed to participate as the examiner of this work.
